# Umbra

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) theme with dark colors inspired by [Bear App](https://bear.app/) colors, GitHub color scheme and [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/).

## Motivation

I wanted a theme with a dark window based on GitHub syntax color scheme because it is simple and consistent. Red and Black is always a great combo.
