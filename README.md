# Umbra

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) theme with dark colors inspired by [Bear App](https://bear.app/) and the GitHub syntax colour scheme.

## Motivation

I wanted a theme with a dark window based on GitHub syntax colour scheme (not available at the time of publish) because it is simple and consistent but with darker backgrounds and tweaked syntax colours.
